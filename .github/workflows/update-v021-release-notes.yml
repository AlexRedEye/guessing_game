### Refactoring
- Consolidated difficulty logic by removing duplicate \`game_easy()\`, \`game_medium()\`, and \`game_hard()\` functions that only differed by their max range. These have been replaced by a single \`game(diff: u32)\` function that accepts the max range as a parameter, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability."
